# spotify-data-science-project
A Data Science Projekt for a University Lab Course.

#### Welcome to the Spotify Group page for the Data Mining Lab SoSe 2022

Here we have taken a Spotify dataset and applying data mining techniques on it. Since Spotify is one of the largest platform for music, it also interesting from a business case perspective.

**At first we want to fokus on the following aspects:**

1. Popular artist and genres
2. Trends in terms of song characteristics
3. Ideal song length
4. Correlation between song characteristics and popularity


## Structure
- Master Branch: Production Code / Finished work (e.g. upload to kaggle)
- Dev Branch: Weekly Exploration and Modeling
